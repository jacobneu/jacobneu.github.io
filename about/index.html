                Hi! My name's Jacob. I'm currently a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/fp-lab/index.aspx">Functional Programming Laboratory</a>, part of the School of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. Before moving to Nottingham, I lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania while completing my <a href="../education">undergraduate (in mathematics) and master's degree (in logic) at Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado (and make it back there as often as I can!).
                </p>

                <p>
                As a researcher, I'm interested in a number of topics across computer science, logic, mathematics, and philosophy. I'm particularly interested in the use of formal logic and advanced mathematical techniques in the design and specification of computer programs. You can read more about my research <a href="../research">here</a>. I also greatly enjoy teaching; my teaching experience encompasses numerous topics, especially type theory, formal logic, and functional programming (<a href="../teaching">learn more about my teaching</a>).
                </p>

                <p>
                In addition to my work, I enjoy several hobbies including cooking, camping, reading, exploring, and amateur photography. I also have several other projects I'm working on (or have worked on), see <a href="../etc">Etc.</a>
                </p>
