                <hr>
                <p>
                I am currently working as a teaching assistant for the CMU Philosophy Department, and plan to begin my PhD studies in 2021.
                </p>

                <p>
                My research explores areas of interaction between mathematical logic, philosophy, and computer science, and seeks to leverage these connections to better understand all three. In particular, I'm interested in the philosophy &amp; logic of nondeterministic action, the interaction between topology &amp; logic, and type- &amp; category-theoretic foundations of mathematics (read more about my research <a href="../research">here</a>). I also greatly enjoy teaching; my teaching experience encompasses numerous topics across these areas, especially type theory, formal logic, and functional programming (<a href="../teaching">learn more about my teaching</a>).
                </p>

                <p>
                I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado, and completed my <a href="../education">undergraduate (in mathematics) and master's degree (in logic) at Carnegie Mellon University</a>. In addition to my work, I enjoy several hobbies including cooking, camping, reading, and exploring. I also have several other projects I'm working on (or have worked on), see <a href="../etc">Etc.</a>
