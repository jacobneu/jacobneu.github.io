                <p>
                I'm currently a graduate student in the Carnegie Mellon University Department of Philosophy, working towards my <a href="../education">MS in Logic, Computation, and Methodology</a>.
                My research explores areas of interaction between mathematical logic, philosophy, and computer science, and seeks to leverage these connections to better understand all three. In particular, I'm interested in the philosophy and logic of nondeterministic action (read more about my research <a href="../research">here</a>). My teaching experience likewise encompasses numerous topics across these areas, especially type theory and functional programming (<a href="../teaching">learn more about my teaching</a>).
                </p>

                I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado, and completed my undergraduate study at Carnegie Mellon University (in mathematics). In addition to my work, I enjoy several hobbies including cooking, camping, reading, and exploring Pittburgh's many wonderful museums. I also have several other projects I'm working on (or have worked on), see <a href="../etc">Etc.</a>
