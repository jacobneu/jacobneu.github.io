				As G.H. Hardy aptly put it, "Beauty is the first test: there is no place in the world for ugly mathematics." Above all, I am interested to discover elegant mathematical theories, which succeed in capturing the mathematical essence of a topic (and all its complexity) in as clean and simple a formulation as possible. But I also have a great preference for theories with deep intuitive roots, theories which elucidate the structure of common experience. My work seeks to balance these goals, by seeing the mathematical structure of everyday existence and by putting in the detailed technical work to capture this mathematical structure in its essence.  
			</p>
			<p>
			My work so far has focused on dynamic topological logic, a branch of modal logic which combines the logic of partial functions (which is intimately connected with topics in theoretical computer science) with topological modal logic (which relates to much research in philosophy and mathematics). Some other topics which interest me include:
			<ul>
				<li>Semantics of programming languages (both denotational and operational)</li>
				<li>Categorical logic</li>
				<li>Higher category theory &amp; higher algebra</li>
				<li>Functional programming</li>
				<li>Homotopy type theory</li>
                <li>Cubical Type Theory</li>
                <li>Semantics of higher inductive types, and (co)modalities in HoTT</li>
				<li>Foundations of mathematics, especially category-theoretic and/or univalent foundations</li>
				<li>The history, philosophy, and pedagogy of mathematics &amp; computer science.</li>
                <li>Formal epistemology &amp; epistemic logic</li>
                <li>Temporal logic &amp; the philosophy of time</li>
			</ul></p>

                    <h4 class="subsect"> Relational Categories </h4>
                    <hr>
					<p> 
					My work on dynamic topological structures has included the study of <em>(bi)simulations</em>, which are suitable transformations between such structures. These transformations, which prove critical in proving many of my main results, also furnish a sense in which the class of dynamic topological models (or frames) constitute a <em>category</em>. My interest is in studying the properties of these categories, and generally articulating the connection between relational categories and modal logic.</p>

                    <p> Part of this has led me to the study of <em>allegories</em>, which are a generalization of the category Rel of sets and relations. I gave a talk on allegories for <a href="https://cmu-hott.github.io/workshop2021.html">a CMU HoTT graduate student workshop</a> in February 2021. <a class="EMLink" href="allegories.pdf"> See here for my slides</a>.
                    Recently, I have been further developing the connection between allegory theory and homotopy type theory. I had the opportunity to give a talk about this research at the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/hott/seminars/index.html">CMU Homotopy Type Theory Seminar</a> in September 2021, the slides for which can be found <a class="EMLink" href="CMU-seminar-Sept2021.pdf">here</a>.

                    <hr>
                    <p> In my spare time, I continue to study several of the topics I initiated with my master's thesis. Most significantly, I have obtained a key characterization result which eluded me when I was working on the thesis. A terse mathematical presentation of this result can be found <a href="https://jacobneu.github.io/research/char.pdf">here</a>. I had the opportunity to present the motivation &amp; details of this result at a summer 2021 meeting of the <a href="https://francescazafforablando.com/pfew">Pittsburgh Formal Epistemology Workshop</a>, the slides for which can be found <a href="https://jacobneu.github.io/research/pfew-2021.pdf">here</a>. I hope to continue making some progress on this project, and perhaps publish some of these results. I am also preparing to formalize some of the results of my master's thesis &amp; related work in the computer proof assistant Lean.

                    <p>
					My master's thesis combines insights from modal logic, formal epistemology, and theoretical computer science into a mathematically-ambitious analysis of a very simple activity: flipping a coin. Based on an insight by my thesis advisor, <a href="https://www.adambjorndahl.com/">Adam Bjorndahl</a>, I develop <em>dynamic topological logic</em> as a suitable language for formally articulating and reasoning about the capacities of knowledgeable agents in situations where <em>nondeterministic</em> actions are possible. I focus on situations where our agent is able to flip a coin to choose between two possible courses of action, and rigorously examine how the uncertainty created by the coin interacts with the agent's capacity for knowledge.
                    </p>
					<p>
					This work is primarily focused on the model theory of dynamic topological logic: "equipping the agent with a coin to flip" corresponds mathematically to a kind of transformation of dynamic topological structures, which I call a <em>program constructor</em>. To fully elucidate the theory of program constructors requires extensive mathematical development, including the introduction of several novel notions in the theory of dynamic topological models and frames. Along the way, I develop a deep connection between program construction in the dynamic topological setting, and analogous processes in the relational model theory of propositional dynamic logic. Though this thesis leaves much work to be done, it establishes a robust framework for future exploration of this very rich topic.

                    <hr>
					<p>
					Though I am still beginning my work on the project, I am working to adapt some of <a href="https://paulaneeley.com/">Paula Neeley's</a> work formalizing relational dynamic epistemic logic in the proof assistant <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean</a>. My goal is to formalize the theory of program construction, both in relational PDL and dynamic topological logic, including the results of my master's thesis.
