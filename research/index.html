				As G.H. Hardy aptly put it, "Beauty is the first test: there is no place in the world for ugly mathematics." Above all, I am interested to discover elegant mathematical theories, which succeed in capturing the mathematical essence of a topic (and all its complexity) in as clean and simple a formulation as possible. But I also have a great preference for theories with deep intuitive roots, theories which elucidate the structure of common experience. My work seeks to balance these goals, by seeing the mathematical structure of everyday existence and by putting in the detailed technical work to capture this mathematical structure in its essence.  
			</p>
			<p>
			My research while at CMU focused on dynamic topological logic, a branch of modal logic which combines the logic of partial functions (which is intimately connected with topics in theoretical computer science) with topological modal logic (which relates to much research in philosophy and mathematics) &mdash; culminating in my MS thesis (see below).
            Since joining the FP Lab in Nottingham, I have been mainly focused on the interplay between functional programming, homotopy type theory, and (higher) category theory. I've especially been concerned with the study of (co)inductive types and the phenomenon of parametric polymorphism.
            Some topics which interest me include:
			<ul>
				<li>Semantics of programming languages (both denotational and operational)</li>
				<li>Categorical logic</li>
				<li>Higher category theory &amp; higher algebra</li>
				<li>Functional programming</li>
				<li>Homotopy type theory</li>
                <li>Cubical Type Theory</li>
                <li>Semantics of higher inductive types, and (co)modalities in HoTT</li>
				<li>Foundations of mathematics, especially category-theoretic and/or univalent foundations</li>
				<li>The history, philosophy, and pedagogy of mathematics &amp; computer science.</li>
                <li>Formal epistemology &amp; epistemic logic</li>
                <li>Temporal logic &amp; the philosophy of time</li>
                <li>Functional reactive programming</li>
			</ul></p>

                    <h4 class="subsect"> (Co)ends, (co)induction, parametricity, and representation independence </h4>
                    <hr>
					<p> 
                        This research project seeks to use the mathematical tools of homotopy type theory (HoTT), and especially category-theoretic concepts imported into HoTT, to study some of the central constructs of functional programming. It encompasses several interesting facets:
                        <ul>
                            <li> <strong>Ends</strong>: one of the basic concepts of category theory are <em>ends</em>, which serve as a generalization of the even-more-fundamental concept of a <em>natural transformation</em>. It turns out that ends provide a robust and flexible framework for expressing some of the key features of various structures in functional programming. Ends are a well-studied notion in category theory, and can be studied even more fruitfully with the power of dependent types and identity types, the core features of HoTT.</li>
                            <li> <strong>Inductive Types as Initial Algebras</strong>: arguably the most-important tool in a functional programmer's toolbox are <em>inductive types</em>, which are data types that allow function definition by <em>recursion</em> and mathematical reasoning by <em>structural induction</em>. The standard category-theoretic treatment of inductive types as <em>initial algebras for (polynomial) endofunctors</em> can be elegantly articulated using ends-in-HoTT, and the key principle allowing for structural induction &mdash; the <em>&eta; rule</em> &mdash; can be nicely and generally stated in this context. </li>
                            <li> <strong>Parametricity and Strong Dinaturality</strong>: a central result in functional programming is known as <em>Reynold's Abstraction Theorem</em> or the <em>Parametricity Theorem</em>. This result governs another critical tool in functional programming &mdash; <em>parametric polymorphism</em> &mdash; and supplies so-called <em>free theorems</em> about polymorphic data. It is well-known that, for certain simple cases, the category-theoretic analogue of parametricity is <em>naturality</em>. The theory of ends-in-HoTT provides convenient notation for the defining <em>dinaturality</em> and <em>strong dinaturality</em>, generalizations of naturality. For essentially all cases of interest to functional programmers, strong dinaturality provides the correct analogue of parametricity, and supplies the correct free theorems. Understanding the exact nature of this relationship is a key focus of mine.</li>
                            <li> <strong>Coends, coinduction, and represenation independence</strong>: a powerful aspect of category theory is its built-in duality: most category-theoretic concepts and results of note admit a "dualization" &mdash; the same idea, but reflected. Ends are no exception: we can dualize them to obtain the notion of <em>coends</em>, which can also be expressed in homotopy type theory. In the same way that ends capture the logic of inductive types, coends capture the logic of <em>coinductive types</em>. Coinductive types, and their main methods &mdash; corecursion and coinduction &mdash; also play an important role in functional programming, and an elegant mathematical description of them is well worthwhile. We can also dualize the idea of parametric polymorphism, to obtain what functional programmers call <em>existential types</em>. Existential types provide a principled way to encode data structures (like stacks, queues, dictionaries, and graphs) in functional programming. A key principle for reasoning about such structures is <em>representation independence</em>: the idea that "indistinguishable" structures are identical. Representation independence is a simple consequence of encoding existential types as coends. </li>
                        </ul>

                    <hr>
					<p> 
					My work on dynamic topological structures has included the study of <em>(bi)simulations</em>, which are suitable transformations between such structures. These transformations, which proved critical in my master's thesis work, also furnish a sense in which the class of dynamic topological models (or frames) constitute a <em>category</em>. My interest is in studying the properties of these categories, and generally articulating the connection between relational categories and modal logic.</p>

                    <p> In my spare time, I continue to study several of the topics I initiated with my master's thesis. Most significantly, I have obtained a key characterization result which eluded me when I was working on the thesis. A terse mathematical presentation of this result can be found <a href="https://jacobneu.github.io/research/char.pdf">here</a>. I had the opportunity to present the motivation &amp; details of this result at a summer 2021 meeting of the <a href="https://francescazafforablando.com/pfew">Pittsburgh Formal Epistemology Workshop</a>, the slides for which can be found <a href="https://jacobneu.github.io/research/pfew-2021.pdf" class="EMLink">here</a>. I hope to continue making some progress on this project, and perhaps publish some of these results. I am also preparing to formalize some of the results of my master's thesis &amp; related work in the computer proof assistant Lean.

Based on an insight by my thesis advisor, <a href="https://www.adambjorndahl.com/">Adam Bjorndahl</a>, I develop <em>dynamic topological logic</em> as a suitable language for formally articulating and reasoning about the capacities of knowledgeable agents in situations where <em>nondeterministic</em> actions are possible. I focus on situations where our agent is able to flip a coin to choose between two possible courses of action, and rigorously examine how the uncertainty created by the coin interacts with the agent's capacity for knowledge.
                    </p>

					This work is primarily focused on the model theory of dynamic topological logic: "equipping the agent with a coin to flip" corresponds mathematically to a kind of transformation of dynamic topological structures, which I call a <em>program constructor</em>. To fully elucidate the theory of program constructors requires extensive mathematical development, including the introduction of several novel notions in the theory of dynamic topological models and frames. Along the way, I develop a deep connection between program construction in the dynamic topological setting, and analogous processes in the relational model theory of propositional dynamic logic. Though this thesis leaves much work to be done, it establishes a robust framework for future exploration of this very rich topic.

					Though I am still beginning my work on the project, I am working to adapt some of <a href="https://paulaneeley.com/">Paula Neeley's</a> work formalizing relational dynamic epistemic logic in the proof assistant <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean</a>. My goal is to formalize the theory of program construction, both in relational PDL and dynamic topological logic, including the results of my master's thesis.
