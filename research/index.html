                    <hr>

                    <p>My Master's Thesis (advised by <a href="https://www.adambjorndahl.com/">Adam Bjorndahl</a>) studies the logic and philosophy of nondeterministic decision-making. When we flip a coin to arbitrarily resolve a binary choice, what is it that we're doing? I examine the <strong>epistemology</strong> of such a situation (i.e. what an agent <em>could come to know</em> about the result of a fair coin flip, before and after the flip), and seek a simple, elegant, yet precise formulation of the structure of an agent's knowledge surrounding this style of "everyday nondeterminism".</p>

                    <p> In support of this analysis, I deploy a wide range of tools from various fields, including topological modal logic, classical dynamic logic &amp; denotational semantics, and model theory. The dynamic-epistemic circumstances of an agent utilizing nondeterministic devices is modeled formally by specialized mathematical structures called <strong>Dynamic Topological Models and Frames</strong>. These structures possess a sufficient richness to interpret a formal language capable of expressing claims about the agent's knowledge-gathering ability and the results of various actions. Furthermore, these structures (and suitable transformations of them) admit straightforward and intuitively interesting axiomatizations in the modal language.</p>

                    <p> I anticipate submitting and defending this work in spring 2020.</p>

                    <p> I have several research interests which I intend on fully exploring as I continue my work.</p>

                    <p> As is likely the case with most research projects, my master's thesis work has prompted far more questions -- deeper, more complex questions -- than it initially sought to answer. My thesis involves the analysis of several "program constructors" (which are a special kind of transformation of relevant models), but it's not clear what kinds of constructions can (or should) fall under this general framework: what instances of program constructors are worth studying, and which aren't? What properties must these constructions have in order to admit analysis and characterization? Furthermore, there appear to be numerous opportunities for expanding this paradigm and connecting it with other fields. How do these constructions behave when there are <em>multiple</em> knowledgeable agents at play, who may have possibilities for shared knowledge (or interesting disparities in knowledge)? How can we encode an agent's (possible) beliefs, suspicions, or intentions in these scenarios? Are there ways to encode the idea of an agent actively modifying the "nondeterministic device" they're interacting with and thereby changing its behavior? These are all interesting avenues of future research.</p>
