            <hr>
            <p>During my time as an undergraduate at CMU (and now as a graduate student), I have had many excellent opportunities to be involved in the education of my peers. As detailed below, this has put me in a diverse set of teaching circumstances: I've led exam reviews with 200+ students, and I've met with students one-on-one; I've designed homework problems, and I've helped students work through them; I've led activities about finding derivatives, and activities about finding the meaning of life.</p>

            <p> My teaching approach is a comprehensive approach which aims to simultaneously engage students with the material and provide them the support they need to thrive. A student with sufficient motivation, encouragement, and structure can master any material; my goal is to provide such an environment. In all my work, I have striven to remove unnecessary barriers to students' learning, provide them a clear and useful structure towards attaining their educational goals, and give them a sense of the elegance and beauty of the subject matter (I have had the great pleasure of teaching some profoundly interesting topics).</p>

            <p> See below for more detailed descriptions of work I've done!</p>

                    <strong> Instructor (Fall 2019, Spring 2020)<br>Guest Lecturer (Spring 2019) </strong>
                    <hr>

                <p> Hype for Types is a student-taught course ("stuco") at CMU which exists to provide students (especially undergraduates with little background in type theory) with an introduction to a variety of topics related to type theory.
                As it stands, many of the most profound and interesting results in computer science and mathematical logic are only accessible to students after years of difficult study -- prerequisite after prerequisite must be taken in order to be able to understand deep results in full detail. With Hype for Types, we aim to present these amazing results without getting into the details, so that our students can understand (at least at a high level) what these topics are about -- without having to come in with a huge amout of background knowledge. For students who do ultimately want to study type theory at a higher level, Hype for Types provides a basic outline of topics currently being studied, so they know what fields in particular are worth pursuing.</p>

                <p> Hype for Types was largely an outgrowth of the core CS course 15-150, and I got to know the original Hype for Types instructors (as well as my current co-instructors) while we were teaching assistants for 15-150 together. I took Hype for Types myself as a student in Spring 2018, delivered a guest lecture (on Hoare Logic) in Spring 2019, and then joined the course as one of the primary instructors for the 2019-2020 academic year. The four lectures I'm delivering this semester are on Dynamic Logic, Category Theory, Categorical Semantics for the Simply-Typed Lambda Calculus, and Homotopy Type Theory.</p>

                    <strong> Instructor (Summer 2020) <br> Head Teaching Assistant (Spring 2018, Summer 2018, Fall 2018)<br>Teaching Assistant (Summer 2017, Fall 2017, Spring 2020) </strong>

                    <p>
                    15-150 Principles of Functional Programming is a core course in the CMU Computer Science curriculum, typically taken by first- and second-year undergraduates studying computer science, mathematics, and related fields. In the course, we teach students the theory and practice of functional programming: recursion, structural induction, evaluation and extensional equivalence, inductive datatypes, parallel and sequential cost analysis, use of higher-order functions, continuation passing style, exception-handling, modular programming, parallel algorithm design, two-player games &amp; alpha-beta pruning, and lazy programming. The course is taught entirely in Standard ML. One of the challenges of teaching functional programming (especially at an introductory level) is that most students coming into the course have never done any functional programming, and do not know how to "think functionally". So the professors and teaching assistants for this course must guide students in learning how to <em>think</em> in a wholly new way, and approach problems from a new mindset.</p>

                    <p> I served as a teaching assistant for this course five times, three of them as the "Head TA". At its largest, this course has as many as 350 students and 30 TAs, and so the job of the head TA is to coordinate the activities of the course staff and make sure the students' needs are being met. Unlike most courses, the homework assignments in 150 are made by the TAs, so as Head TA I would supervise groups of several TAs as they revised a homework assignment (and wrote new problems, as needed) and developed test cases for "auto-grading" the student's code submissions, and I also oversaw the grading process after the homework was due. As Head TA, I conducted interviews and decided which people to hire as TAs, and it was my job to look after the course staff, ensure they were able to fulfill their duties, and that they were equipped to make the course as excellent as possible. All five semesters I was a TA, I was responsible for holding weekly office hours, and I taught an hour-and-a-half lab session each week to review lecture material.
                    </p>

                    <p> In 2020, I plan on returning to 15-150. In the spring, I'll rejoin the course as an "Infrastructure TA" (a teaching assistant tasked with maintaining and operating the course infrastructure). In summer 2020, I will serve as the instructor, where I'll be in charge of the entire course and will deliver all the lectures.</p>

                    <strong> Teaching Assistant (Fall 2019)</strong>
                    <hr>

                    <p> As a graduate student in the philosophy department, I have the wonderful opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant for the department's Introduction to Philosophy course, taught by Prof. Simon Cullen, with assistance from Prof. Clark Glymour. Intro to Philosophy is designed to give students a broad introduction to issues of contemporary interest in philosophy, especially questions in applied ethics and metaphysics. The goal of the course is to significantly sharpen student's analytical reasoning skills, so, even if they ultimately aren't interested in philosophy itself, they will still receive tremendous benefit from having taken the course. The homework assigned to students requires them to construct "argument diagrams" (like the one pictured on the left), visually depicting a particular line of reasoning. Extracting these diagrams from (even sharply-written) philosophical prose is no easy task, so the course is designed to help students gradually develop this skill. However, once one has a diagram of a given argument, it becomes much easier to assess the strength of the argument, articulate its basic assumptions, and subject it to substantive critique.
                    </p>

                    <p> My role as teaching assistant for this course consists of grading student work, holding office hours, meeting with students to help them in the course, and teaching two sections of a weekly recitation. I design my recitations to give students the opportunity to critically evaluate the arguments presented in lecture &amp; assigned readings, discuss with their peers, and refine their own position on the philosophical issues. I adopt a collaboration-oriented approach which emphasizes student interaction and discussion, and minimizes instances of me "lecturing". We have lively debates in recitation, covering a wide variety of topics and viewpoints.
                    </p>

                    <p> I also had the opportunity to deliver one lecture for this course:<a href="https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/80100F19/readings"> Lecture 26</a> on Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". </p>
